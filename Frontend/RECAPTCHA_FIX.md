# üîß reCAPTCHA Issue Fix

## üö® Problem
The authentication system was requiring reCAPTCHA verification for both sign-in AND sign-up, which created a poor user experience as users had to complete CAPTCHA every time they tried to log in.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Modified Authentication Logic**
- **Sign-In**: No longer requires reCAPTCHA - users can sign in quickly without verification
- **Sign-Up**: Still requires reCAPTCHA for security (prevents automated account creation)

### 2. **Updated Auth Service (`src/firebase/auth.js`)**
```javascript
// Before: Required reCAPTCHA for both sign-in and sign-up
async signInWithEmail(email, password, recaptchaVerifier) {
    // Always required reCAPTCHA verification
}

// After: Optional reCAPTCHA for sign-in, required for sign-up
async signInWithEmail(email, password, recaptchaVerifier = null) {
    // Only verify reCAPTCHA if provided (optional for sign-in)
    if (recaptchaVerifier || this.recaptchaVerifier) {
        try {
            await (recaptchaVerifier || this.recaptchaVerifier).verify();
            console.log("‚úÖ reCAPTCHA verified for sign-in");
        } catch (error) {
            console.warn("‚ö†Ô∏è reCAPTCHA verification failed, proceeding without it for sign-in");
        }
    }
    // Continue with sign-in...
}
```

### 3. **Updated UI Component (`src/pages/signin/page-new.jsx`)**
```javascript
// Before: Always setup reCAPTCHA for both sign-in and sign-up
const recaptchaVerifier = authService.setupRecaptcha('email-recaptcha-container')

// After: Only setup reCAPTCHA for sign-ups
let recaptchaVerifier = null;
if (isSignUp) {
    recaptchaVerifier = authService.setupRecaptcha('email-recaptcha-container');
}

// Sign in without reCAPTCHA, sign up with reCAPTCHA
const result = isSignUp 
    ? await authService.createAccountWithEmail(email, password, displayName.trim(), recaptchaVerifier)
    : await authService.signInWithEmail(email, password) // No reCAPTCHA
```

### 4. **Conditional reCAPTCHA Display**
```jsx
{/* reCAPTCHA container - only for sign up */}
{isSignUp && (
    <div className="space-y-2">
        <p className="text-xs text-gray-400 text-center">Please complete the security verification</p>
        <div className="flex justify-center">
            <div id="email-recaptcha-container" className="min-h-[78px] flex items-center justify-center"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
)}
```
